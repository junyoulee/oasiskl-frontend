### Iteration 1:
#### Epic 1: Green Space Discovery (MUST HAVE)
This epic helps KL residents easily find and explore green spaces in the city. Many people don’t know where to go for outdoor activities, and information about parks is often scattered or incomplete. With an interactive map, users can search for parks, gardens, and nature spots, check detailed information, and plan their visits more easily.

##### User Story 1.1 - Discover Nearby Green Spaces
As a KL resident with limited knowledge of local nature spots, 
I want to use an interactive map on the OasisKL website to explore all available parks, gardens, and natural areas in my vicinity, 
so that I can easily discover green spaces near me and reconnect with nature despite living in an urban environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria 1.1
Given the user wants to look for a specific green space,
when they are in the ‘Interactive Map’ tab in our website,
then they should see a map with markers of green spaces and an A-Z ordered list of all available green spaces, categorized by region.

#### User Story 1.2 -  Access Detailed Green Space Information
As a KL resident planning outdoor activities, 
I want to access comprehensive information about each green space from the map interface, 
so that I can make informed decisions about which locations best suit my needs and preferences before visiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria 1.2
Given the user is on the ‘Interactive Map’ tab in our website,
when they click on a green space marker on the map,
then an information panel should display the park name, address, nearby public transport options, opening hours, available facilities (e.g., restrooms, jogging tracks, picnic spots), and photos with user reviews, whenever possible.

### Epic 2: Biodiversity Showcase  (MUST HAVE)
This epic allows users to discover and learn about plants commonly found in KL’s green spaces. After selecting a park, users can browse the common plant species found there. By clicking on a plant's name, they can access detailed information about its characteristics, scientific classification, and care guidelines. 

#### User Story 2.1 - Browse Plants in Green Spaces
As a nature enthusiast, 
I want to find out about plants found in specific parks, 
so that I can learn about local flora during my visits.

#### Acceptance Criteria 2.1
Given the user is viewing a green space’s details page,
when they click "View Garden Plants,"
then they should see a list of the common plants in that green space, displayed with images and names in alphabetical order.

#### User Story 2.2 - Access Plant Details
As a plant lover, 
I want to view detailed information about specific plants, 
so that I can learn about their characteristics and care requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria 2.2
Given the user selects a plant from the list of common plants, 
when they get sent to a separate tab for that plant, 
then they should see comprehensive information including scientific name, description, and care requirements for light, water, temperature, and soil for that plant.
